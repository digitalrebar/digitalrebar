      Skip Flash
      ----------

      skip-flash tells Rebar to skip performing any flash operations on
      a machine.   It can be either true or false.

      Firmware Target Versions
      ------------------------

      firmware-target-versions is a per-machine attrib that contains
      a map of firmware-test -> version overrides, where firmware-test is the
      name of a test field in the list of tests in the firmware-selection-tests
      attrib.

      This attrib allows you to pin firmware versions for a specific machine -- in the
      absence of an entry for a firmware test in this attrib, the firmware-flash role
      will try to flash up to the latest firmware update package available for a matching test.

    documentation: |
      Firmware Package Information
      ----------------------------

      The firmware-packages attrib contains all of the firmware packages that
      Digital Rebar knows how to flash, regardless of system type.  It consists
      of a JSON object that maps the full filename of the firmware update package
      to metadata about that package. The metadata is defined as follows:

      ::
        {
          "source": "The full URL the firmware update package should be downloaded from",
          "sha256sum": "The SHA256 checksum of the firmware update package",
          "script": "The script that will be invoked by the firmware-flash role to apply the firmware update"
        }

      The firmware-flash role expects to be able to download the firmware
      update package from the provisioner (at $provisioner/files/firmware/$package_name).
      In order to make the update package available, you need to download the update
      package from its source, and then upload it to the provisioner with:

      * ``rebar provisioner files upload $downloaded_file as firmware/$package_name``

      The script that applies the firmware update package should take care to reboot the system
      if that is required to complete the firmware update.

      Firmware Selection Tests
      ------------------------

      The ``firmware-selection-tests`` attrib is used by the ``firmware-flash`` role to
      determine what firmware update packages (as defined by the ``firmware-packages`` attrib)
      should be applied to a given system.  It consists of a lists of tests with the
      following structure:

      A map of firmware type: version.
      If an entry for a type is missing, the flasher will assume you want the latest version.
      ::
        {
          "test": "The name of the test."
          "current-version-script": "A shell script that gets the current version of the firmware in question."
          "packages" [
            {
              "package": "The name of the package in the firmware-packages attrib",
              "version": "The version of the package",
              "downgrade-fence": true or false,
              "upgrade-fence": true or false
            }
          ],
          "match": {
            "dmi_attrib": "value that must match",
            "other_dmi_attrib": "value that must match"
          }
        }

      The packages section of the test structure can contain any number of packages that
      can be flashed for the specific test.  The packages list must be ordered in ascending version
      order with the earliest version at the top.

      The keys of each individual entry in the packages list:

      * "package" is the name of the package in the firmware-packages attrib.
        If there is no matching entry in the firmware-packages attrib and this
        package was chosen to be run, the update will fail.
      * "version" is the version of the firmware update package.  The version string
        should be vaguely semver-ish.
      * "downgrade-fence" indicates that the formware in question cannot be downgraded
        past this version.
      * "upgrade-fence" indicates that this package must be flashed when upgrading to
        a later version.

      The match section consists of an object whose keys are the names of node attribs, and
      the values are the exact values that the attrib in question must match exactly.  These
      are what determines if a given test is applicable to a given system.  The attrib names
      must be in the following list:

      * bios-vendor
      * bios-version
      * bios-revision
      * system_manufacturer
      * system_product
      * baseboard_manufacturer
      * baseboard_product_name
      * ipmi-enable
      * ipmi-firmware-rev
      * ipmi-device-id
      * ipmi-device-rev
      * ipmi-mfgr-id
      * ipmi-product-id
      * raid-detected-controllers
