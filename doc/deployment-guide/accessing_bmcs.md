## Connecting to the BMC Network

By default, Crowbar sets up the BMC network on 192.168.128.xxx/24.  You may, of course, modify this by changing the BMC network in the `/networks` page.  These instructions have been created with the assumption that you are using the default network and should be modified to match your specific configuration.
