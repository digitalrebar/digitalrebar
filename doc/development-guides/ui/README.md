### User Interface Development

Crowbar uses the basic Rails MVC approach for UI development with some small AJAX extension.

While there are more sophisticated and scalable models, the development team feels that Rails MVC provides sufficient experience without additional complexity.  Maintainability and simplicity of the UI are primary goals at this point.

We expect to revisit this assumption in the future and encourage community development of this UI or other approaches.
