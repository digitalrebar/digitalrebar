Welcome to a Barclamp for the OpewnCrowbar Framework project
=======================================================
_Original Copyright 2013, Dell, Inc._
The code in this repository is Apache 2 licensed.

The Crowbar Framework (https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar) was developed by the Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team (http://dell.com/openstack) as a OpenStack installer (http://OpenStack.org) but has evolved as a much broader function tool. 
A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar.  Core barclamps operate the essential functions of the Crowbar deployment mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific applications.

* This functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required *
